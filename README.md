Dubai Real Estate Property Price Prediction
Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to predict the actual prices of properties in Dubai's real estate market. By utilizing machine learning models, we aim to provide accurate price estimates for different properties. This project can assist buyers, sellers, and industry professionals in making informed decisions within the dynamic real estate landscape of Dubai.

Installation Instructions:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install all the required libraries for data analysis and the scikit-learn library.
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

Usage:
Download and run the "Forecasting_Real_Estate_Prices_in_Dubai_using_Machine_Learning_Models.ipynb" notebook.
Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to execute the project.
Dataset and Preprocessing:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the official government website of Dubai. To obtain the dataset, please refer to the website (provide URL if applicable). Preprocessing steps, such as cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, were performed to prepare the data for model training.

Model Training & Evaluation: Explored regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso) and tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBM) to predict property prices in Dubai's real estate. Evaluated using RMSE

Results and Interpretation:
The results of the trained models and their performance are summarized in the notebook. Visualizations and examples are provided to illustrate the insights gained from the project.

Future Improvements:
There are several potential areas for future enhancements in this project, including:

Expanding the dataset to include more recent and diverse property listings.
Refining the models by exploring different algorithms or optimizing hyperparameters.
Adding new features that could contribute to better price predictions.
